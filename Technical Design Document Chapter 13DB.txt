Program Description
This program creates a SQLite database named population_MF with a table population containing population data for 10 cities in Florida. It initializes the table with population data for the year 2023, simulates population growth over the next 20 years at a 2% annual growth rate, and allows users to visualize the population growth for a selected city using Matplotlib.
Variables
* cities: A list of tuples containing initial population data for 10 cities in Florida for the year 2023.
* selected_city: A string representing the city chosen by the user for visualizing population growth.
* years: A list of integers representing the years for which population data is available.
* populations: A list of integers representing the population data corresponding to the years.
Functions
1. create_database()
o Description: Creates the SQLite database population_MF.db and the population table.
2. insert_initial_data()
o Description: Inserts initial population data for 10 cities in Florida for the year 2023 into the population table.
3. simulate_population_growth()
o Description: Simulates population growth over the next 20 years at a 2% annual growth rate and inserts this data into the population table.
4. display_population_growth()
o Description: Prompts the user to select a city from a list, retrieves population data for the selected city from the database, and displays the population growth using Matplotlib.
Steps of the Program
1. Create the Database and Table:
o Call the create_database() function to create the SQLite database population_MF.db and the population table.
2. Insert Initial Data:
o Call the insert_initial_data() function to insert initial population data for 10 cities in Florida for the year 2023 into the population table.
3. Simulate Population Growth:
o Call the simulate_population_growth() function to simulate population growth over the next 20 years at a 2% annual growth rate and insert this data into the population table.
4. Display Population Growth:
o Call the display_population_growth() function to:
* Print a list of 10 cities in Florida and prompt the user to select a city.
* Retrieve the population data for the selected city from the population table.
* Use Matplotlib to display the population growth for the selected city.
